# Morphological_Operators

Morphological operations are a set of operations that process images based on shapes. They apply a structuring element to an input image and generate an output image. The most basic morphological operations are two: Erosion and Dilation

In this repository, I am going to show you how can you remove noise with the help of Erosion and Dialtion.
